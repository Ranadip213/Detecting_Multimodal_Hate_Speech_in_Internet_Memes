# Detecting_Multimodal_Hate_Speech_in_Internet_Memes

Introduction:

This project aims to develop a multimodal machine learning model capable of classifying inputs containing both textual and visual information. The model will be trained on a dataset consisting of text descriptions paired with corresponding images, and it will learn to predict the category or label associated with each input.

Dataset:

The dataset comprises two main components: text data and image data. The text data consists of textual descriptions or captions associated with each image, while the image data consists of the visual content represented as image files.

Text Data Preprocessing:

Convert text to lowercase.
Remove non-alphanumeric characters.
Tokenize text into words.
Remove stopwords.
Lemmatize words.
Image Data Preprocessing:

Resize images to a consistent target size.
Normalize pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
Model Architecture and Training Methodology:

The multimodal machine learning model will consist of two main components: a text processing pipeline and an image processing pipeline. The output features from both pipelines will be combined and fed into a classifier for prediction.

Text Processing Pipeline:

Convert text to TF-IDF vectors.
Dimensionality reduction (optional).
Image Processing Pipeline:

Use pre-trained convolutional neural networks (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to extract image features.
Model Architecture:

Combine the output features from text and image pipelines.
Feed combined features into a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine).
Training Methodology:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Validate the model on the testing set.
Performance Evaluation:

The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics to assess its effectiveness in classifying inputs based on both text and image data.

Metrics,
Accuracy,
Precision,
Recall,
F1 Score,
ROC AUC Score,
Confusion Matrix.

Conclusion:

The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal machine learning approaches for text and image classification tasks. By leveraging both textual and visual information, the model is expected to achieve superior performance compared to unimodal models.

Future Directions:

Future work may involve exploring advanced multimodal architectures, incorporating attention mechanisms, and experimenting with different combinations of text and image features to further improve model performance.
